# My idea about the problem:

1. I start by initializing two variables, count and maxCount, to help me keep track of consecutive 1's in the binary array.

2. I then proceed to loop through the nums array, examining each element one by one.

3. Whenever I encounter a 1 in the array (that is, when nums[i] is 1), I increment both count (to maintain a count of the current consecutive 1's) and maxCount (which holds the maximum consecutive 1's found so far).

4. If I encounter a 0 in the array, I reset count to 0 because consecutive 1's have been interrupted.

5. Finally, after the loop, I have the value of maxCount, which gives me the maximum consecutive 1's in the array.

This algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n represents the length of the nums array, as it only requires a single pass through the array.
