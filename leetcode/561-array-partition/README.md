# My idea about the problem:

1. I have an array of 2n integers, nums, and my approach is to create optimal pairs.

2. I start by selecting the two smallest integers in the array as the first pair, (a1, b1).

3. I continue by picking the next two smallest integers as the second pair, (a2, b2), and so on, until I've formed all n pairs.

4. Then, I calculate the sum of the minimum value in each pair and return this sum as the maximized result.

By forming pairs with the two smallest integers at each step, I ensure that I maximize the sum of the minimum values in each pair, which aligns with my initial approach.
