# My idea for this problem

First, I will convert the input string s into an array to make it easier to work with individual words.

Then, I will loop through the array from right to left. This order ensures that the words will be processed in reverse order.

As I loop through the array, I will create a variable to store the reversed string.

Within the loop, I will append each word to the reversed string, separating them by a single space.

Finally, I will return the reversed string, which will contain the words in reverse order with a single space between them.

This approach effectively reverses the order of words in the input string s while ensuring that there are no extra spaces and no leading or trailing spaces in the output.
