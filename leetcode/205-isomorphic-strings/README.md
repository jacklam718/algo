# My idea for this problem

1. Creating Two Hash Tables: Creating two hash tables to map characters in s to characters in t and vice versa is a good approach. This allows you to track the mappings in both directions.

2. Checking the Hash Tables: Checking the hash tables to ensure that the current character is not already mapped to another character and that the mapping is consistent is a valid way to determine if the strings are isomorphic.
   

```
Mapping from s to t:
-------------------------------
| s Character | t Character |
-------------------------------
|     e       |     a       |
|     g       |     d       |
|     g       |     d       |
-------------------------------

Mapping from t to s:
-------------------------------
| t Character | s Character |
-------------------------------
|     a       |     e       |
|     d       |     g       |
|     d       |     g       |
-------------------------------
```

Another example:
```
Mapping from s to t:
-------------------------------
| s Character | t Character |
-------------------------------
|     f       |     b       |
|     o       |     a       |
|     o       |     r       |
-------------------------------

Mapping from t to s:
-------------------------------
| t Character | s Character |
-------------------------------
|     b       |     f       |
|     a       |     o       |
|     r       |     o       |
-------------------------------
