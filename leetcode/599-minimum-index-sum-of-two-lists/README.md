# My idea for this problem:

1. We initialize a min variable to store the minimum index sum and an array result to store common strings with the minimum index sum.
2. We check if a string exists in both list1 and list2. If it does, we calculate the sum (i + j).
3. If the current index sum is less than the minimum index sum we've seen so far, we treat the current index sum as the new minimum index sum. We reset the result array and add the current string (list1[i]) to it.
4. If the current index sum equals the minimum index sum, we add the current string (list1[i]) to the result array.
