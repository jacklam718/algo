# My idea for this problem:

**Initial approach**
1. Initialize a hashtable buckets to store grouped strings.
2. Iterate through the array strs.
3. Sort each element string of the array, e.g., cba becomes abc.
4. Use the sorted string as a key for the hashtable and store the original string in the corresponding array value.
